### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
    I learned how to properly center a div element horizontally.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    #divname {
        margin: 0 auto;
    }
}
```

### Continued development
    I should like to further my knowledge on flexible grids, and the 'display: flex;' property and value.

### Useful resources

- color picker app.
